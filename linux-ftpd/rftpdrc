# This is a demo configuration for rftpd

# configurations, such as RNIC, memory, disk, etc.

# Memory configuration
# rftp designs a ring buffer to match RDMA asynchronize IO mechanism.
# 'maxbufpoolsiz' sets up the ceiling size of memory used for data transfer.
# Note: memory block size is determined by client side's configuration.
#maxbufpoolsiz = 100M

# Communication configuration
# 'srvcomport' specifies the listening port for incoming connection.
# Note: the number of data transfer streams is determined by client side.
#srvcomport = 9987

# RDMA related configuration
# 'rdma_qp_sq_depth', 'rdma_qp_sq_depth' and 'rdma_cq_depth' setup
# the depth of send queue, receive queue and completion
# queue, correspondingly.
# To handle various kinds of completion, RFTP designs three pools of thread,
# 'send worker thread', 'recv worker thread' and 'write worker thread'.
# 'wcthreadnum' defines the number of threads for each pool, and 'wceventnum'
# specifies the maximum number of completion events.
#rdma_qp_sq_depth = 1280
#rdma_qp_rq_depth = 1280
#rdma_cq_depth = 2000
#wceventnum = 600
#wcthreadnum = 4

# disk io parameters
# 'devzerosiz' setups the /dev/zero size if a task loads data from /dev/zero.
# 'readernum' and 'writernum' defines the number of disk io threads that
# load and offload data between memory and disk. If direct IO is supported
# by file system, 'directio' could enable this io accelaration feature.
#devzerosiz = 10G
#readernum = 1
#writernum = 1
#ioengine = sync
#directio = yes
#disk_io_siz = 512K

# 'usesendfile' and 'usesplice' defines how the application performs
# data transfer over TCP connections.
#usesendfile = no
#usesplice = no
